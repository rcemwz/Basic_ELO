# Basic-ELO
Basic ELO-style ranking system based on a win/lose result between two parties.

Made to test system before implementation in Java, where win/loss inputs would be automated by event listeners and scores stored within a database.

Parties have a numberical score, which translates into a rank in 250-brackets (i.e. 0-249 = rank 0, 250-499 = rank 1, 500-749 = rank 2, etc).

A win result between parties of the same rank cause a 15-point change to both parties (winner gains 15 points, loser loses 15 points), for each rank difference, point changes are then altered by 2 points, with limits to prevent gaining or losing more than 25 points per interaction.

Point changes are applied, and the ranks are recalculated, if a rank change has occured, this is stated.


Examples:

(Winner) rank 1 vs rank 1 (Loser)
Gain 15 points : Lose 15 points

(Winner) rank 1 vs rank 2 (Loser)
Gain 17 points : Lose 17 points

(Winner) rank 2 vs rank 1 (Loser)
Gain 13 points : Lose 13 points

Effectively, this is to encourage challenging higher-rank parties, and discourage 'bullying' lower-rank parties.


Clauses:

Overscore - when point changes >25, limits to 25

Underscore - when points changes <5, limits to 5

Negative cap - when losers points after changes <0, sets to 0
